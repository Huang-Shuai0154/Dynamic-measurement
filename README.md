There are four scripts in this repository in the "code" folder.The"fft RF-AM-MLP.py","fft-MLP.py","Linear static.py" are the training and testing procedures of "RF-AM-MLP","MLP" and "static linear model" respectively. And after training all the three models are saved to remain there parameters unchanged.The "fft plot figures.py" compares the three models using different validation sets which are 30rpm,60rpm,100rpm and variable rates.And different figures are drawn to show the prediction results and error distribution of the three models. All the data appeared in the four scripts are provided accordingly in the "data" folder.
(Attention:For the zoom picture of each rate in "fft plot figures.py",readers shoule change the sample range manually in the code to match the sample range of pictures in the papper.The sample time is 140ms and you can calculate the time according to the number of sample points.)
