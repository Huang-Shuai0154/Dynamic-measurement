There are four scripts in this repository.The"fft RF-AM-MLP","fft-MLP","linear static 2" are the training and testing procedures of "RF-AM-MLP","MLP" and "static linear model" respectively. And after training all the three models are saved to remain there parameters unchanged.The "fft plot figures" compares the three models using different validation sets which are 30rpm,60rpm,100rpm and variable rates.And different figures are drawn to show the prediction results and error distribution of the three models.
